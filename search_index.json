China amounts to half of the global slaughter number. The EU slaughters about half of China’s number and the US is half of the EU. Russian and Brazilian numbers are next, but don’t even combine the reach the US slaughter numbers. The largest importers of pork meet is shown in the plot below, units are in 1000’s of tons. The Asian markets and Mexico have an appetite for pork. US trade relations with the East and Mexico are key for the pork market. 3.2 Balance Sheets The table below shows the US swine animal numbers balance sheet. These numbers are shown in units of 1000’s of heads. Notice the increase in projected slaughter numbers from 2019 to 2020. This amounts to an increase of 1.69%. Notice that the US have to slaughter around 11 million heads of swine every month to meet these projected slaughter numbers.

To Sows 3 1 2.03 3.31 -2.62 The plot below shows the monthly projected slaughter numbers. The dark and light shaded regions represent 80 and 95 percent confidence intervals. The dashed red line shows the 90th percentile of monthly US slaughter numbers. Notice that the mean projected slaughter numbers are all well above the percentile reference. Another way to view this data is cumulatively. The plot below shows the cumulative projected slaughter numbers up to December. The horizontal dashed lines shows the US projected slaughter numbers. Similar to above the dashed red line gives the 90th percentile. Notice that the mean projection will only barely reach the target set by the USDA. To be safe they will have to reach slaughter numbers greater than the top marker of the 80% confidence band. The swine meat balance sheet for the US in shown in the table below. Here the units are in 1000’s on tons. The increase in meat production from 2019 to 2020 is 3.24%. To achieve these production numbers the US requires sufficient capacity to slaughter all the required hogs.

Data for the current year is shown in red. The mean slaughter numbers are represented by the solid black line. The dashed and dotted line show the 90th and 10th percentiles respectively. Notice the large decreases during the onset of the Corona Virus Crisis in the United States. The plot below is the same as those above but shows the data on a US wide level. Here the rounded values are also shown on the graph in millions of heads. We can see that the current pace of port production will not be able to reach the goal set by the USDA. 3.4 Slaughtering Capacity The table below shows the total slaughtering capacity of each state. The capacity and old columns show the fall 2018 and fall 2019 capacities respectively. This data was scraped of the pork.org website and is measured in heads of swine on a daily slaughtering basis. Iowa and Michigan will have the largest increases in plant capacity. state_alpha type capacity old change US normal 506470 494535 11935 IA normal 152300 142300 10000 NC normal 48250 48400 -150 IL normal 48200 47300 900 MN normal 45100 45100 0 IN normal 33800 33800 0 MO normal 32000 32000 0 NE normal 29125 28950 175 OK normal 20500 20500 0 SD normal 19500 19500 0 PA normal 14550 15050 -500 MI normal 12500 12500 0 CA normal 12150 10800 1350 KY normal 10900 10900 0 VA normal 10490 10490 0 OH normal 5150 5250 -100 TN normal 3950 3950 0 WI normal 3000 2750 250 TX normal 1700 1700 0 OR normal 1075 1075 0 KS normal 1000 1000 0 ID normal 730 720 10 AL normal 300 300 0 NJ normal 200 200 0 state_alpha type capacity old change US sow 17440 16690 750 IA sow 4000 4000 0 TN sow 3950 3950 0 WI sow 3000 2750 250 IL sow 2250 2250 0 MI sow 1000 500 500 KS sow 1000 1000 0 OH sow 950 950 0 KY sow 900 900 0 AL sow 300 300 0 VA sow 90 90 0 Below we show a google map view of where the plants are located. The radius of the marker corresponds to the plant capacity. Zooming in around the main markers we can see that the majority of the pork processing plants are located around the Des Moines area in Iowa. Clicking on the marker gives some mone information about the specific plant and its capacity. Plants with increasing capacities are shown in green. The remainder of the plants are shown in blue. Studying the plot above we might ask if it is good practice to think of the US pork industry on a state or country wide basis. The majority of the pork packing facilities are located around Iowa. There are two islands outside the main area, one in Oklahoma and the other in North Carolina. It is interesting to note that the West Coast don’t have great packing capacity. The plot below shows the difference in available capacity and the daily slaughter point forecast. A positive (negative) number implies sufficient (insufficient) capacity and is indicated as a blue (orange) coloured bar. Iowa is going to have capacity constraints going into October. These capacity constraints will be felt in the total US numbers from September 2019 through to January 2020. Throughout we use the top bar of the 80% confidence band because this gives a cumulative slaughter number that equates with the projected slaughter numbers of the USDA. 3.5 Implications In the United States we have seen many processing facilities operating at half capacity due to the Corona Virus Crisis. This has further reduced the meat packing capacities and have increased the meat packing margins to astronomical levels. The reduced packing ability has forced the lean hog prices down even though meat prices in the supermarkets are trading at elevated levels due to people buying bulk to weather out the Corona Virus Storm. The reason for this is that a larger number of farmers are competing with each other to get their product to the processing facilities. The processing facilities can then just take the cheapest carcasses. This created a downward spiral in the lean hog price. "]
